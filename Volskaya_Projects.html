          <p style="font-size: 18px;">September 3 - September 11, 2019 for Computer Science Principles</p>
          <br>

          The objective of the project was to create a working game on the platform called Scratch, which we could show to our class. My partner and I got very creative with ideas for our game, and decided on a simple arcade game, because we knew our limits of knowledge in coding and Scratch. I learned to use drag-and-drop code, as well as how to animate a background using code and make a sprite move on it. My partner and I switched off between coding and navigating very well, so our share of both roles was equal. A challenge we encountered had to do with repetition of actions, but we worked it out in the end. We were proud of<a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/327228456/"> the end result</a>.</p>

            <strong>MIT App Inventor Project</strong></p> 
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">September 23 - October 8, 2019 for Computer Science Principles</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">The objective of the project was to create a working app for an Android device, or an Android emulator.  My partner and I were new to the MIT App Inventor, so we encountered some issues with how to customize and expand our app from the tutorial. My partner and I switched off between the roles, and both learned how difficult making an app actually is. With teamwork, though, we finished <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FhA3vxOme1eZMH3T7MhqDJWgHuAg8rvd" target="_blank">the app</a> to our liking, and shared our work with the class.</p>

            <strong>Compound Machine Project</strong></p> 
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">November 9 - December 4, 2020 for Honors Principles of Engineering</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">In this project, our team was working towards the objective of building a working compound machine using household materials. We met during and outside of class to make a plan of what we needed to do before our next meeting. While a lot of the work was completed as a team, my main contribution was creating the video presentation that we would present to the class. An obstacle I faced was having to use a corrupted file from a classmate, which the video editing program would unfortunately crop. After failed attempts of re-rendering, I ended up screen recording the video which is how I was able to continue. Once the project was completed, we organized all of the work on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1crDoJRddWE6KF2YWZhkBMnV0vbYN6dWkRXESJVqw12c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation page</a>, where the video, as well as images of our sketches and models, is linked.</p>

            <strong>Bridge Designer Project</strong></p> 
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">March 19 - April 9, 2021 for Honors Principles of Engineering</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">The objective of the project was to create a functioning bridge design that would be stable enough to carry a load, while facing constraints such as build cost, material cost, and individual material properties. It was interesting to get to know the bridge building software, as my partner and I were both new to it at first. This definitely brought some challenges in the beginning phases of our project. Another difficult aspect of the project was to figure out where to sacrifice stability for a lower cost. After many experiments and failed designs, my partner and I were able to come up with a cheap design for a steel bridge that could carry a truck across a waterway. My main responsibilities included explaining our final decision and defending the design in the Design Matrix, as well as describing our final product in detail in the Design Evaluation.

            <strong>Greenfoot Gameboard Project</strong></p> 
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">July 18 - August 30, 2021 for AP Computer Science Applications</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">For this project, my partner and I worked together to modify the code of a program in Java, using an application called Greenfoot. The application was intended to be a multiplayer boardgame, which made it interesting, but also brought some challenges. The most difficult thing to create an algorithm for was specific character movement using user input, and moving the player piece a number of tiles, along the correct path. Once we got through this obstacle though, the project went more smoothly. The skills I learned from this project were to code with a teammate virtually, since this project started in the summer, as wel as using user input for specific movement in Java. My main contributions consisted of assisting with troubleshooting, any image manipulation that was necessary, as well as a part of the documentation.

            <strong>Researching Topics in CS Project</strong></p> 
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">January 31 - February 21, 2021 for AP Computer Science Applications</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">This project was a deep dive into the "applications" aspect of the AP CSA class, because I was pushed out of my comfort zone to use a python framework to test the efficiency and functionality of the Raspberry Pi. We asked ourselves the question -- how do we create a standardized method in order to link a raspberry pi to a UI component? Time was the most challenging constraint because we had less than a month to learn how to use a python framework, since different team members had different levels of experience with this subject area. We ended up writing a python code that would collect data from a sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi, which was tested beforehand with a simpler objective of making a LED light on a breadboard blink. In this project, I learned how python frameworks were used with physical components, as well as how to document the process.
