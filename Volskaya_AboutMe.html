          <h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
          <p>Hello! My name is Palina Volskaya and I am a junior at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Applications. My career goal is to have a stable, well paying job, and most importantly, to love what I do for a living. My plans to achieve my goal are: to take every opportunity I can in high school, map out future professions and career paths I would want to explore, and find a college that suits my needs. In high school and college, I will make good use of school, which will be reflected in grades that I am proud of as well as keeping myself in good health. I also want to make sure I am taking in and applying the information I learn, not just memorizing it for a test or quiz. I will take these steps so that I do end up going to work at a job I hate every single day. I want to be able to earn reasonable money for my work, and ensure that my family is always living in good condition. I want to be able to be independent and provide for myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          A prominent trait of mine is that I am persistent. If an assignment needs to be done, or a topic needs to be studied, I work towards finishing whatever I need to do. For example, I never leave assignments past their due date, as well as putting in daily effort into my extracurriculars. This quality is important to help me achieve my goals. I make sure to make the most out of my assignments and projects, and enjoy attending various talks from guest speakers in different engineering fields. I have participated in interesting projects that have expanded my knowledge on both engineering as well as professional teamwork. Another trait of mine is that I am able to pick up things very quickly, from things such as languages (both world and computer), and different applications. I am currently learning Spanish and Korean, as well as Java in my CSA class. In my free time, I like to work on video projects in applications such as Adobe After Effects or Premiere Pro, whether they are individual or collaborative efforts. These projects are then posted on a social media page where I get a feel for marketing - figuring out tactics that increase engagement.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of my notable accomplishments is joining the high school debate team. While the club does not relate to engineering, it develops the skill of presenting, public speaking, researching, and checking information, which are important skills for any job area. I have learned it is difficult for me to focus and motivate myself, but once I do, I work really well both on my own and in a team, and that I will put in my best efforts to get the job done.
          <br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, I am still deciding on which career path I am leaning towards, but I have the traits and work ethic to hopefully turn my goals into reality, as well as many interests to choose from. I am eager to learn, and use what I have to achieve the goals that I set for myself.
