          <h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
          <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Palina Volskaya and I am a senior at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in PLTW Cybersecurity. My future career goal is to have a stable, well paying job, and most importantly, to love what I do for a living. To achieve my aspirations, I will continue to balance personal enrichment and mental and physical wellbeing, as well as applying the information I learn instead of just relying on memorization. With these steps, I hope to avoid waking up to go to a job I hate every single day. I want to be able to earn reasonable payment for my work to ensure that my family is living in good condition, as well as achieving independence and being able to provide for myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          A prominent trait of mine is that I am persistent. If an assignment needs to be done, or a topic needs to be studied, I work towards finishing whatever I need to do. I never leave assignments past their due date, as well as putting in daily effort into my extracurriculars. This quality is important to help me achieve my goals. I make sure to make the most out of my assignments and projects, and enjoy attending various talks from guest speakers in different engineering fields. I have participated in interesting projects that have expanded my knowledge on both engineering as well as professional teamwork. Another trait of mine is that I am able to pick up things very quickly, from things such as languages (both world and computer), and different applications, such as Adobe After Effects. During my time in high school, I have studied Spanish and Korean, as well as HTML, Python, and Java in my computer science classes. In my free time, I like to work on video and graphic design projects in applications such as Adobe After Effects or Premiere Pro, whether they are individual or collaborative efforts. These projects are then posted on a social media page where I acquire experience in marketing — figuring out tactics that increase engagement.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of my notable accomplishments is joining the high school debate team. While the club does not relate to engineering, it develops the skill of presenting, public speaking, researching, and checking information, which are important skills for any job area. Additionally, I’ve been working on my improvisation and leadership skills as a Freshman Mentor. I’ve realized that I work really well both on my own and in a team, and that I will put in my best efforts to get the job done.
          <br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, I have the interest, efficient traits, and work ethic to carefully turn my goals into reality, as well as many interests to choose from to pursue in the future. I am eager to learn, and use my strengths to achieve the goals that I set for myself. Continue looking through my portfolio to find more about me and my work, as well as ways to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for your time!</p>
