        <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
        <p>During my time in DEDA's engineering program, I had the opportunity to meet numerous industry professionals through field trips and guest speaker presentations. Some were professionals in the industry, while others were Dublin High School alumni, sharing their journey from high school to college. The presentations were very inspirational, because they made my future seem more reachable and realistic. I'm grateful for their time spent with us and for the helpful advice that was offered.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Field Trips</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Google Headquarters, February 28, 2020</strong>
        <br>
        I have been very fortunate to take a spot in a field trip to the Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California. We met with TV Show host Kari Byron, and watched the filming of a Google Talk, where Kari discussed her ideas, as well as information about her old shows and a preview for her new show. While Byron isn't necessarilly a computer scientist or software developer, her career path is truly inspiring. It took Byron a long time to get where she is today, but it wouldn't have been possible without her hard work and ambition. She is very open to experimenting and trying new things, and does what she loves for a living, which I want for my future self as well. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <strong>Junior Achievement Oracle Job Shadow - October 7, 2020</strong>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-7">
            This field trip consisted of an introduction from the Vice President of Software Engineering at Oracle, followed by breakout rooms with Oracle professionals who talked about their path to their position as well as the daily tasks and duties of their job. It was really interesting to have so many people in the industry in one call, and I was grateful for the advice that they gave. Many gave tips on mindset, personal growth, as well as an interactive conversation about what to do during an interview evaluation. I found their advice incredibly helpful, and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to listen to them explain what I will have to be ready for in the future.

        <h3><strong>Guest Speakers</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Cesar Nicola, VP Project Development - Blue Trail Software</strong>
        <br>
        My biggest takeaway from this guest speaker was that it is important to have structure in your workforce, in this case being agile and scrum methodology, as it will bring success. As well as introducing students to agile, he talked about working remotely as a team, and pros and cons about international projects, which could easily be useful in my future career. Nicola also emphasized the importance of an individual in a group project, and how it is important to be responsible and not fall out of line in order for the project to be successful. He talked about how it is necessary for a company to be able to adapt to their client's needs and the industry's competition. His speech was both educational and inspirational, and I found it very interesting.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jason Yosinski - Machine Learning</strong>
        <br>
        From this presentation I learned the importance of ingenuity in your career, as shown with the topic of machine learning. Yosinski introduced the audience to machine learning, which is a machine that is able to learn over time. In his presentation, he stressed the importance of determination rather than a clear plan from day one, and shared his story of trial and error that lead to success. He shared his presentation on his progress and how his team had to take different approaches to achieve their end result.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Trisha Shah - Dublin High School Alumni</strong>
        <br>
        From Shah's presentation, I learned about the importance of finding your own path. I was inspired by her story, and how she learned to stay true to herself, and found a pathway that she would enjoy, instead of being pressured into another field of study. She also introduced a relatively unique major, Management Information Systems, and explained what type of work it circles around, what opportunities she had related to it, and what it meant for her in the future. She also gave advice for both academics and life in general, which revolved around having fun and taking steps to create a career completely unique to yourself and your interests.
